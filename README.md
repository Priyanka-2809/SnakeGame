## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The snake game project is a classic video game implementation that involves controlling a snake as it moves around a rectangular grid. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food items, which causes it to grow longer. However, the game becomes challenging as the snake's length increases and it must avoid colliding with its own body or the game boundaries.
